Hi Martin,

  So sorry to get back to you late. It's been a busy week. 

  Nice work on the plots! That's exactly the right way to make the histogram. 

  Now that you're making the plots, let me give you a bit more information and your next assignment. 

1) These numbers represent the masses of ``something" in the CMS detector. Each file is calculating the mass in one of two different ways. Note that I'm not 
saying these are the masses of a *particle*. Right now, they are just the masses of something. 

2) The next thing is that you're running into the same problem that we run into in our data....sometimes there's a problem with the detector or electronics, 
and we get numbers out that just don't make sense. So let me give you a clue, numbers greater than about 100.0 are not valid. So set up the histogram, 
so the range is from 0 to 100. You may also want to change the number of bins if you like. That may or may not emphasize different features in the data. 

   When you have done this, I believe we will start to see things in the data that we can talk about and I will then tell you more about these data.  :)

   Your guess about the Higgs is a good one! But, I'm afraid to disappoint, that is not it. It's not quite _that_ easy!  :)

   Talk to you soon. 

Matt
